# P2PLoanData_AnalysisAndRecommendations
Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform and online credit marketplace enabling borrowers to apply for unsecured personal loans from 1,000 to 40,000.Investors can browse borrower loan listings and select loans that they want to invest in, based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade assigned by Lending Club and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest on the loans. Lending Club earns revenue by billing borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee. Investors provide loans with the hope to make a profit from the interest payment by the borrower. There are many different factors that affect a borrowerâ€™s credit risk, thus assessing it is a highly complex task. The underlying motivation for this coursework is determining findings of relevance to model credit risk.

This project explores the various research questions:

What are the factors which influence the status of a loan? Which features explain it the most and which are irrelevant?
To what extent can an investor predict the status of a loan.
What are the factors which influence the interest rate for a loan? Can we explain this to a borrower?
Can investors identify loans ignoring the grades and still get good returns?
What are loans being used for and does it impact the loan defaults?
